Life Expectancy Analysis: Exploring Global Health Trends**

Project Overview
This project investigates life expectancy trends across different countries and regions, focusing on the factors influencing variations in longevity. By leveraging data-driven insights, the analysis aims to uncover relationships between life expectancy and socioeconomic, healthcare, and environmental indicators.

The project provides visualizations and statistical insights to better understand global health inequalities and the driving factors behind them.


## **Dataset Description**
The dataset used in this project is titled **"Life Expectancy Data (Averaged)"** and contains the following columns:

- **Country**: Name of the country (string).
- **Region**: Geographic region of the country (string).
- **Year**: The year of observation (integer).
- **Life_expectancy**: Average life expectancy at birth in years (float).
- **Adult_mortality**: Number of adult deaths per 1000 individuals (float).
- **Infant_deaths**: Number of infant deaths per 1000 live births (integer).
- **Alcohol_consumption**: Alcohol consumption per capita in liters (float).
- **BMI**: Average Body Mass Index (BMI) in the population (float).
- **GDP_per_capita**: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita in USD (float).
- **Schooling**: Average years of schooling (float).
- **Incidents_HIV**: Percentage of people living with HIV (float).
- **Polio**: Immunization coverage for Polio (percentage) (float).
- **Economy_status**: Categorical indicator of whether the country is developed or developing (string).
- ... *Other health and socioeconomic indicators.*

## **Key Objectives**
1. Identify countries and regions with the highest and lowest life expectancy.
2. Analyze correlations between life expectancy and key factors such as:
   - GDP per capita
   - Healthcare indicators (e.g., immunization, BMI, infant deaths)
   - Socioeconomic status (e.g., education, income).
3. Create visualizations to highlight global disparities in life expectancy.
4. Investigate trends in life expectancy across time for various regions.

---

## **Key Insights**
- Regions like **Africa** have the lowest life expectancy values due to higher rates of poverty, diseases, and limited healthcare access.
- Developed countries show higher life expectancy due to better healthcare systems, education, and economic stability.
- Strong positive correlation between **GDP per capita** and **life expectancy**.
- Higher levels of **education (schooling)** and lower levels of **adult mortality** are linked to increased life expectancy.

## **Visualizations**
1. **Heatmap**: Correlation of life expectancy with other factors.
2. **Boxplot**: Regional distribution of life expectancy.
3. **Choropleth Map**: Global life expectancy visualized by country.
4. **Bar Charts**: Highlighting countries with the highest and lowest life expectancy.

## **Requirements**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `numpy` for numerical computations.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations.
  - `plotly` for interactive choropleth maps.
